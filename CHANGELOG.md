# 0.2.1
> 2017-07-23

#### Bug fixes
- The compiled file should now be included in the published module. Sorry about that!

# 0.2.0
> 2017-07-22

#### New features
- `bsb` calls have been optimized and now only run once when the plugin is loaded
- `bsb` now watched for changes as a separate process, so your reason files are always being compiled
- tests have been added and coverage is now at 100%

#### TODO
- Full examples
- Integration with different projects to ensure it works well
