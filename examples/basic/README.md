# basic example

This is one of the most basic forms of using `babel-plugin-bucklescript`. This creates a reason file with a simple function, and a javascript file that uses that function.

For more info on ReasonML's syntax, see their [documentation](https://reasonml.github.io).

# Setup

First, install the project dependencies.

```sh
npm install
```

Once everything is installed, you can then build the project.

```sh
npm run build
```

Finally, you can use node to execute the file.

```sh
node dist/index.js
```
